# Winning team of [Bobst Challenge](BOBST_Tech-Talk.pdf) @ [LauzHack 2017](http://2017.lauzhack.com/)

# TLDR
Making use of computer visualization tools such as OpenCV, our team managed to detect defect in a manafacturing envirronment, a challenge proposed by Bobst company. We were even the only team to fully solve the problem during Lauzhack 2017 hackathon where ~250 participants where competing on various challenges.

# LauzHack 2017

LauzHack is a student-run hackathon at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

Hackathons are creativity marathons, where attendees work in teams to create something exciting in a short time.

During hackatons, sponsors usually propose challenges to the attendees. We decided to go for the Bobst Challenge

# Bobst Challenge

Bobst is one of the **world’s leading supplier** of equipment and services to **packaging** and **label manufacturers**.

## Build a defect detection algorithm

Develop an algorithm to rapidly **identify defectives boxes** in a 10.000 pictures database.

Find **reliable solutions** to distinguish real defects from natural process variations (position, dust, crease, etc.)

Uncover our **motto** based on the identified defects

## Criteria

Judgment criteria are algorithm **reliability**, process **speed** and the **creativity** of your strategy

## Development Environment

Each team will get **1 USB 3.0 stick** with the box pictures to process

Any **library** you can find can be used.

Our **server** is at your disposal to **benchmark** your algorithm (Linux or Windows Server).

Our engineer team will take shifts to **support you night and day**.
